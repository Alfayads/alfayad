## üîß Troubleshooting

### Analytics Not Working?

**Check 1: Environment Variable**
```bash
# Make sure the variable exists
cat .env.local | grep GA_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

**Check 2: Correct Format**
- Must start with `G-`
- Example: `G-ABC123XYZ`
- No quotes needed in .env.local

**Check 3: Vercel Environment Variables**
- Make sure you added it to Vercel dashboard
- Redeploy after adding the variable

**Check 4: Browser Network Tab**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Filter by "google-analytics" or "gtag"
- Reload page and check for requests

### Still Not Working?

- Analytics may take 24-48 hours to show historical data
- Realtime data should appear immediately
- Some ad blockers may prevent GA from loading
- Test in incognito mode

- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix makes it available in browser (required for GA)
